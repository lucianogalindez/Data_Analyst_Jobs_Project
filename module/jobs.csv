Data Analyst,Recidiviz,via AngelList,"$80k – $110k • No equity

About Recidiviz...

Recidiviz is a non-profit technology company building common, open-source technical infrastructure to help the criminal justice system reduce incarceration and achieve better outcomes, both for the public and those within the system.

Criminal justice data today is fragmented and hard to use. Our platform not only links and standardizes data across silos, but exposes it in usable formats to help drive state criminal justice agencies toward real-time, data-informed decision making. Recidiviz helps justice agencies test what’s working and what’s not—and then do more of what’s working. Our mission is to build healthier, safer communities by improving outcomes for justice-involved people.

Company History

Since our founding in February 2019, we’ve built an incredible team of more than 50 engineers, scientists, designers, product managers, and domain experts. To date, our team has partnered with eleven states, representing a quarter of the nation’s incarcerated population. And we’re just getting started. For more about us, check out:
• Website: recidiviz.org

• Github: github.com/recidiviz
• Twitter: twitter.com/recidiviz

(You can also read a bit more about our founder on Fast Company, Time, or Forbes 30 Under 30.)

About the Role

We are focused on expanding our team’s work and deepening its impact everywhere we are deployed. We’re hiring Recidiviz’s next Data Analyst to help drive that impact at the forefront of our work. This role works closely with our State Engagement Managers and our Implementation Engineers to guide work that targets the drivers of incarceration in specific systems and contexts. Data Analysts work with diverse data – criminal justice data both raw and processed from across the country, reports and policy documents from government agencies, and much more – to develop our understanding of American criminal justice and motivate change. They delve into questions as diverse as: which interventions and programs lead to positive outcomes and for who, how policy and practice impact the outcomes of incarcerated and supervised people, which portions of the justice system reverberate the most profound bias, and which avenues for impact show the most promise. Our Data Analysts also play a key role in contextualizing and presenting their analyses to key stakeholders, both internal and external.

We are looking for people who have an attention to detail to provide rigor to our analysis, creativity and inquisitiveness to identify and solve open-ended problems, clarity to think through complex and variable data, flexibility to adjust in a rapidly evolving environment, and above all else, a collaborative, kind nature to add to our culture.

We are open to candidates with variable levels of experience, junior, mid-level, or senior: these have different compensation levels within the band on this job posting.

Core responsibilities
• Exploring our datasets and those of other organizations to find new insights about the state of American criminal justice
• Communicating key findings to improve our understanding of the drivers of incarceration and help prioritize our efforts
• Working alongside our State Engagement and Implementation Engineering teams to analyze specific sectors of criminal justice, at various levels of abstraction and focus
• Working with our Data Science and Software Engineering teams to bring analytical work into production software
• Analyzing trends and changes in areas related to our own work to understand how our products function

Minimum qualifications
• Bachelor’s degree in a technical or mathematical field or equivalent experience
• 1+ year of practical experience exploring and analyzing complex datasets
• Comfort working in SQL to process complex datasets
• Experience preparing analytical reports and/or research for publishing
• Strong communicative and descriptive abilities, to help nurture a knowledgeable, data-oriented culture in our organization and in the criminal justice space at large

Preferred qualifications
• High familiarity with Python, R, or other popular, open-source data analysis environments
• Experience in a cross-functional setting, capable of working closely with State Engagement, Implementation Engineering, and Data Science teams
• Willingness to question source data, examine results closely, and provide constructive feedback
• Comfort working with external partners from diverse backgrounds and worldviews, including government staff, researchers, journalists, and other practitioners in criminal justice reform
• Experience with making data analysis replicable, reproducible, and readable, particularly through dashboarding tools like Looker, Tableau, or others
• Experience navigating large datasets from the public sector and academic communities, especially related to criminal justice, would be a plus
• Familiarity with our data stack would be a plus, including Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery, Jupyter notebooks, and Looker

Compensation & Benefits

Recidiviz offers:
• The opportunity for growth in a mission-driven environment
• A remote work environment + two offices (one in NYC and one in SF)
• 14 company holidays and 20 days PTO
• An annual Company Offsite
• 90% of the medical/dental/vision insurance premiums for you and 60% for dependents
• 5% match on Retirement plan (401K) with no vesting period

New York Life’s protection-first advice and guidance methodology takes a holistic approach to providing sound financial advice. We use a unique, outcome orientation approach that’s delivered with genuine care, designed to offer our clients real peace of mind.

Our new GuideMe platform is the digital planning tool that helps our agents bring this approach to life. It’s designed to modernize our agent case design and presentation abilities in a way that meets the evolving expectations of modern consumers.

Data Analyst,Fetch,via BeBee,"What we're building and why we're building it.

Fetch is a build-first technology company creating a rewards program to power the world. Over the last 5 years we've grown from 0 to 7M active users and taken over the rewards game in the US with our free app. The foundation has been laid. In the next 5 years we will become a global platform that completely transforms how people connect with... brands.

It all comes down to two core beliefs. First, that people deserve to be rewarded when they create value. If a third party directly benefits from an action you take or data you provide, you should be rewarded for it. And not just the ""you get to use our product"" cop-out. We're talkin' real, explicit value. Fetch points, perhaps.

Second, we also believe brands need a better and more direct connection with what matters most to them: their customers.
-- Brands need to understand what people are doing, and have a direct line to be able to do something about it. Not just advertise, but ACT. Sounds nice right?

That's why we're building the world's rewards platform. A closed-loop, standardized rewards layer across all consumer behavior that will lead to happier shoppers and stronger brands.

Fetch Rewards is an equal employment opportunity employer.

The Role

The Data Science & Analytics team embodies these values and works with a laser focused objective to enable data driven decision making for both internal stakeholders and external partners. We are looking for a Data Analyst to contribute to this vision and reap the rewards of joining an exciting company in the high growth phase.

You will create analytical solutions that help Fetch teams leverage and monetize actionable insights from our unique data. This is a challenging and high visibility position, responsible for creating these solutions as well as influencing technical direction. Success in this role requires the ability to take on challenging problems and design & develop an amazing solution with little to no assistance.

You possess:
• Ability to create SQL/Python programming modules for custom insights required by our Product Teams. Leverage statistical analysis to understand what is ""acceptable"" versus ""outliers"".
• Ability to present insights to business stakeholders through Tableau (primary) / Powerpoint / Excel in a compelling manner.
• Ability to successfully collaborate with both business users and engineers for effective analytical solution development and deployment. Create automated KPI dashboards and monitoring reports.
• Passion to drive actionable insights from product usage and other relevant data to measure success of experiments, diagnosis of issues, understanding of general consumer behavior.
• Knack for conducting the apt Data Exploration needed to enhance the cleanliness and effectiveness of our data sources.
• Discipline to create well documented coding and analytics packets to ensure reusability as the team expands.

Bonus points for:
• Expertise in Tableau dashboarding, active within Tableau Community
• Experience in analytics at app-based / Consumer Tech companies
• Familiarity with Big Data frameworks like Snowflake, Spark and AWS services
• Effective communication, ability to translate and explain technical issues to non-technical team members
• Love of Dogs . . . Or just tolerance. We're a very canine-friendly workplace

About AcreTrader

AcreTrader launched in 2018 and has established itself as a leader in the farmland investment industry. Our team and company have grown at an incredible pace, and to continue this growth, we must do so intentionally. We have very high expectations for ourselves, each other, and every new team member. We’re looking for high performers who go about their work with a sense of curiosity and a drive to make things better. AcreTrader is an equal-opportunity employer. We recognize that diverse teams are the strongest teams and we encourage individuals of all backgrounds to apply. If you would like to be a part of a fast-moving operation with an opportunity to make a massive impact at the intersection of finance, technology, and agriculture—then please, get in touch.

AcreTrader is a real estate investing platform that makes it easy to buy shares of farmland and earn passive income. United States farmland has historically outperformed most asset classes and other forms of real estate. Unfortunately, buying and maintaining farmland directly is extremely difficult without local knowledge and management, as well as large investment commitments. AcreTrader solves these issues by providing transparency, flexibility, and ease of use to people wanting to invest in farmland while handling all aspects of administration and property management, from insurance and accounting to working with local farmers and improving soil sustainability. At the same time, AcreTrader works to help farmers scale through innovative sales and leasing opportunities. See our How it Works page for more details.

AcrePro is a modern land brokerage committed to providing an excellent buying and selling experience with unparalleled service and transparent access to land data and technology. AcrePro grew out of a need recognized by its sister company, AcreTrader, to empower clients to buy and sell land smarter, with advanced technology, data, and expertise. Providing our agents with best-in-class marketing support is a cornerstone of our growth strategy. Rapidly expanding throughout the nation, AcrePro’s seasoned agents work alongside the client to walk the land and secure the best terms for each transaction.

Acres is the most comprehensive, accurate, and useful mapping tool for land. There are over 50 million farmland owners in the world that require a better service to explore their land. That includes using satellite imagery to discover how land has evolved, pricing land at market values through valuation algorithms, and exploring many layers of underlying agronomic information. Our team solves complex computer science problems, designs beautiful and intuitive product experiences, and improves the accuracy of our data to set the industry standard for mapping.

You will:

Support dv01’s Credit Facility offering. You will be a critical piece in supporting and expanding dv01's footprint in the Warehouse Lending space, working to improve the efficiency, expediency, and accuracy around our clients' reporting requirements.

Ensure that all Credit Facility client needs are met. You will be responsible for producing Borrowing Bases, Monthly Servicing Reports, and other reporting deliverables for a variety of borrowers, lenders, and other counterparties that leverage dv01’s Credit Facility offering.

Actuarial Data Analyst,Ledger Investing,via AngelList,"About the Team:

Data scientists at Ledger are critical to the success of the company. Our team specializes in modeling the behavior of casualty insurance risk portfolios. We analyze and predict the performance of every insurance program that seeks capital through us, and our analyses are critical in determining on what terms, if any, our investors are willing to offer capital for each program... In short, our math forms the ground truth that serves as the basis of negotiations for transactions with tens of millions of dollars at stake.

About the Position:

The quality of our analyses is fundamentally dependent on the quality of the underlying data. We regularly receive policy and claims data from a wide variety of sources and in a wide variety of formats. In order to provide accurate and up-to-date projections of portfolio performance to investors, we need accurate and up-to-date data on the insurance programs in the portfolio. We have tools in place to automate the process of loading of updated data in a known format, but we still need keen human eyes whenever we get raw data in a new file format.

Our data analysis team ensures that we correctly understand the semantics of each new source file format, and that new data sources are correctly uploaded to our risk data warehouse. Source data is often ambiguous, incomplete or inconsistent, and the team works directly with risk originators to identify and fix these issues. The team helps other teams within the company construct business definitions and build queries for metrics of interest that can be derived from policy and claims data. Finally, the team works closely with engineers to improve the architecture and performance of the data warehouse.

If these problems sound fun and interesting, we'd love to have you on our team.

About You:

Successful candidates will have all of the following attributes:
• Professional, hands-on experience manipulating policy- and claim-level data from property and/or casualty insurers.
• Strong understanding of the core business concepts in property and casualty insurance.
• Demonstrated ability to identify, isolate, and correct issues in messy data.
• Ability to work with and integrate data sources in a wide variety of formats (CSV, XLSX, databases, flat files, JSON, etc) and perform checks for integrity, consistency, and accuracy against known sources of truth.
• Significant experience with Python, R, VBA, or another language commonly used for data manipulation; basic exposure to Python
• Ability to work independently and communicate ideas effectively.

The following attributes will help you stand out from the crowd:
• Experience with writing unit tests and documentation for source code.
• Familiarity with core concepts in statistics and data science.
• Familiarity with version control, especially Git/GitHub.
• Experience with data visualization, particularly for data dashboards.

Your Benefits:
• Competitive salary, bonus potential, and equity compensation
• Work from anywhere. We’re flexible. Our headquarters is in New York, but this position can be fully remote or hybrid.
• Uncapped paid time off
• Paid Holidays
• 401k
• Medical, dental, and vision insurance - multiple plans to choose from
• Company paid Life and AD&D insurance
• ClassPass - We contribute to your monthly membership offering a large range of providers & services in Fitness and Wellness. Get a massage on us!
• Up to $5,000 paid by Ledger towards your dream desk setup! Customize what works for you.

"Data Engineer I, Data Analytics",FiscalNote,via LinkedIn,"About The Position

At FiscalNote, we build platforms that connect people to their governments, and our Data Analytics team builds tools, processes, and reporting capabilities to integrate operational data and enable enterprise decision-making. As a Data Engineer on the Data Analytics team, you recognize the value of properly collecting, managing, analyzing, and reporting data to improve... operational efficiencies, customer experience, and financial performance, and want to be the architect of a centralized data warehouse and enterprise level analytics and reporting platform that impacts decision making across the company. You will work closely with our product, engineering, and operations teams to build a robust and scalable analytics stack and perform various data analysis projects on how our business is performing, how we interact with our clients and prospects, and how they use our products.

About You

You understand that business teams need to have trust in the accuracy of incoming data in order to shape their decision making around it, and choose to relentlessly seek solutions when you notice anything is amiss. You believe that data and analytics need to be relevant, actionable, and timely and that the most comprehensive data collection and accurate analytical model that does not change action is useless. You’re comfortable around ambiguity with a high degree of autonomy, and are excited about solving complex, open-ended problems by distilling the complexity as simply as necessary to build solutions that work. Along the way, you’re capable of communicating what you’re thinking to both technical and non-technical audiences, taking in others’ ideas as well as expressing your own.

What To Expect In This Position
• As an individual contributor on the Data Analytics team, you will work closely with the Data Infrastructure team and collaborate with stakeholders across the Business Development, Account Management, Finance, and Product teams to gather data and reporting requirements and drive the development of data models, pipelines and platforms to extract and consume data for reporting and analysis tools
• Work closely with the Product & Engineering teams to manage product usage requirements and analytics
• Create reporting and conduct ad-hoc analyses on financial, operational, and product data
• Work with business and engineering teams to build and maintain integration points and efficient ETL pipelines
• Build, test, and maintain a scalable and robust analytics stack
• Write documentation and reporting requirements
• Create and govern data warehouse architecture and data quality and integrity
• Serve as an analytics expert to establish and communicate best practices internally to both technical and non-technical stakeholders

What Sets You Apart
• 1-3 years combined as a data engineer or data analyst
• 1-3 years of database expertise, including intermediate SQL
• 1+ years of experience in data analysis and business intelligence
• 1+ years of programming experience (Python)
• Experience with cloud data warehousing (AWS Redshift, Snowflake, etc.)
• Experience with data ingestion/transformation tools (DBT, Stitch, Fivetran, etc.)
• Demonstrated experience developing with data reporting and visualization tools (Looker, Tableau, Domo, Thoughtspot, etc.)
• Experience working with product analytics (Mixpanel, Amplitude, Heap, Segment, Pendo, Gainsight, etc.)
• An independent motivation to solve problems
• Ability to communicate with technical and non-technical stakeholders to understand business and technical processes
• Experience in establishing, implementing, and socializing analytics best practices with both technical and non-technical stakeholders
• Experience with distributed computing data platforms (Databricks, Spark, Glue) is a plus

How We Work

Freedom and Flexibility: At Loom, we believe work is an act, not a place. When we disengage work from a location, we can accommodate a broad range of life choices. You can choose to work from home or while you travel. We are able to hire across the United States and are continuing to expand our international presence. And you are free to move within a country without any adjustment to compensation.

Engaging Workday: The key to an engaging workday is finding the right balance between different ways to work sync, async, text and video. Loom makes it easier for us to say what we mean without having to schedule a zoom meeting or struggle to find the right words. And using async communication allows us to free up time for deep work every day. We believe there's a place for sync time - often a conversation on Zoom is exactly what is needed. For team meetings, this ‘sync time’ is typically between 9AM-Noon PT given where the overlap of timezones where Loommates are located.

Work-Rest Balance: The way we balance the fast-paced demands of a high-growth startup and sustainability is making rest a priority. We offer a flexible PTO policy so you're able to take time off when you need it. We also go fully offline for Summer Break around 4th of July and between Christmas and New Years. Rest is also part of the workday, not just during PTO. Taking a break for personal commitments, whether it's watching the kids or getting some exercise is a natural part of the workday.

Social Connection: Relationships and connectedness matter. We are intentional about building trust and relationships through unique, shared experiences. Our virtual workspace keeps us connected day-to-day whether it's through Looms celebrating wins or our buzzing Slack communities. Loommates are able to meet in person with their teams at least twice a year purely for fun. We have also built local offices for those who want to work or meet in person, starting with San Francisco and New York City.

Data Analyst for Start-Up,Upwork,via Upwork,"Our Mission: is to build the most delightful healthcare experience and make it accessible to everyone.

Here’s The Scoop...

We built Vitable because healthcare is complex and expensive, but we all need it.

We're a team of engineers, clinicians, and operators redesigning how healthcare fundamentally works for the 80 million uninsured and under-insured Americans. We started with a simple vertically integrated primary and urgent care health program through a network of nurse practitioners that come directly to members virtually or through in-home visits. We designed our plan to make high-quality concierge care accessible to everyone - from the Grammy winners that have used us to our uninsured members.

We're growing fast at 5x ARR over the last six months. We are well-capitalized by world-class investors like Y Combinator, Softbank, and First Round Capital, along with incredible founders and operators with experience building and funding unicorns like Michael Seibel (YC, Twitch), Immad Akhund (Mercury), Allison Pickens (Gainsight), Jack Altman (Lattice), Dan Folkman (GoPuff) and others.

Ready to roll your sleeves up and make this happen?

We're hiring an experienced Data Analyst who is passionate, detail-oriented, and motivated to get things done!

Data Analyst to create dashboards,Upwork,via Upwork,"Greetings! I'm looking for a strong data analyst that specializes in reporting and visualization. We are an e-learning company that distributes online learning via our Learning Management System (LMS). We have some clients that will be using an e-learning standard called xAPI.

xAPI will write statements to a Learning Record Store (LRS) system. In this system, it collects a log of activities that... need to be analyzed and visually reported. I do not need help writing the statements to the LRS, rather, I need someone that understands how to plot data and create dashboards based on the data available in the LRS.

The LRS system I plan to use is called Veracity. Here's some information on how to create dashboards in their system: https://lrs.io/home/features.

The dashboard would be simple (Counts, Min/Max, Average, Sum) by Student, Course, Lesson, etc.

Please review the link above as it contains good information on how to create dashboards and reports.
